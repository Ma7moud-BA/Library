# Prisma Client Configuration Module

The `prismaClient.js` module is responsible for configuring and exporting an instance of the Prisma Client for database interactions. It handles different setups for development and production environments to ensure efficient database connections.

## Usage

In your application, you can import and use the `prisma` instance as follows:

```javascript
import prisma from './prismaClient';

// Example usage:
async function getUsers() {
  const users = await prisma.user.findMany();
  return users;
}

// Use the 'prisma' instance for database queries and operations.
```
# Overview
The prismaClient.js module does the following:

- In a production environment, it creates a new instance of the Prisma Client (PrismaClient) to establish a fresh database connection for each request or operation.

- In a development environment, it reuses a global instance of the Prisma Client (PrismaClient) to optimize database connections and `prevent resource leaks`.

## Exported Object
prisma (PrismaClient): The Prisma Client instance configured for your application's environment.

# Notes
- Ensure that you have properly configured the NODE_ENV environment variable to distinguish between production and development environments.

- Prisma Client should be imported and used as needed for your database operations, following Prisma's documentation and best practices.

- Customize the module as required for your specific project's database setup and requirements.
