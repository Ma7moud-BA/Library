# `ThemeSwitcher` Component

The `ThemeSwitcher` component is a React component that provides a user interface for toggling between light and dark themes in a web application. It uses the `DarkModeSwitch` component from the "react-toggle-dark-mode" library and the `useDarkSide` custom hook to manage the theme state.

## Usage

```javascript
import ThemeSwitcher from './ThemeSwitcher';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      {/* Other content */}
      <ThemeSwitcher />
      {/* Other content */}
    </div>
  );
}
```
##  Overview
The ThemeSwitcher component does the following:

1. Theme State Management: It uses the useDarkSide hook to manage the current theme state and the DarkModeSwitch component to allow users to toggle between light and dark themes.

2. Toggle Functionality: When the user interacts with the DarkModeSwitch, it triggers the toggleDarkMode function. This function updates both the theme state and the checked status of the switch.
## Notes
1. Ensure you have installed and configured the "react-toggle-dark-mode" library in your project for this component to work correctly.

2. The useDarkSide hook manages the theme state and must be imported and used in your project as demonstrated in the example.

3. Customize the appearance and behavior of the DarkModeSwitch component as needed for your application.
